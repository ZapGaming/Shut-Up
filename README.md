# Shut-Up

## I would recomend you to host this on render and its very easy

go to the render projects section and make a new web service

set the respitory as   https://github.com/ZapGaming/Shut-Up and the branch as main

leave the build command as the default which is this if u are deploying locally or something   pip install -r requirements.txt

the start command is  python bot.py or python3 bot.py

and under enviroment varibles set DISCORD_TOKEN  as your discord bots bot token  (u can make a bot in the discord developer portal)

### and now you just have to deploy it and get someone to shut up!
